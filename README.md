<h1>The Secret Sauce App</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

As a secret-keeper, I want to encrypt messages with a passphrase, so that I can securely send secret messages.

As a secret-keeper, I want the encrypted messages embedded in a URL, so that I can post links publicly where someone with the pass phrase can decrypt them.

As a passphrase knower, I want to click a link that has a secret message in it, so that I can enter the pass-phrase and read the message.
